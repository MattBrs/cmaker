** Pending feature list
    - Create cmake automatically with "init" function
    - Build project
    - Clean project
    - Add flags to project cmake
    - Add libraries to project:
        - Define a repository with compile instructions
        - Use the program to pull the library repo and build with the instructions automatically
        - Add to cmake automatically

** Ideas
Maybe do separate cmake files? 
    - link_libs
    - include_dirs
    - main_cmake

So the app can add or remove the libs from the dedicated files without searching in a big single file.
